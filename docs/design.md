# Design

## What I want from my design

- Simplicity: The idea is to create a design that **maximizes simplicity**, but
  does **not compromise beauty or functionality**
- For shapes, I want to use the easiest shape in HTMT/SVG, the
  rectangle. Since a simple rectangle can look too simple, my idea is to
  beautify it with pastell colors and and a grainy effect, hopefully signalling,
  that this desing choice is intentional.
