= Vite

What do I expect from Vite

In my current development, I want to use the
https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] module to parse my input und convert it
into HTML. _AsciiDoctor_ is installed with npm, the node package module, so
there not a direct way of using this module in a browser. Vite simplifies this
for me by taking care that even in a browser environment I can use node modules.

Vite was originally developed for https://vue.dev[Vue] but is now supporting a
variety of other frameworks and Vanilla JavaScript/Typescript, which is
especially important for me. Additionally it keeps the end result small with
tree-shaking and minification.

Scaffolding works with the following command:

[code, bash]
----
npm create vite@latest <project> -- --template vanilla-ts
----
