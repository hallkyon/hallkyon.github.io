= Class: `Canvas`
:toc:

Class handling the visualization of the graph.

*Superclass:* `BaseClass`

*Used By:*

* `app`
* `DrawingVertex`
* `Embedder`

== Attributes

=== `private static _instance: Canvas`
=== `private _canvas: HTMLElement`
=== `private _graph: Graph<DrawingVertex>`
=== `private readonly _edgeMap: Map<DrawingVertex, Map<DrawingVertex, DrawingEdge>>`
=== `private _pointerDown: boolean`
=== `private _domPoint: DOMPointReadOnly`

For zooming and panning the distance between two points, while considering the viewBox, needs to be calculated. Using `DOMPointReadOnly` objects for this makes it easier, because this object is affected by the viewBox too. 

== Methods

=== `private getDomPoint(event: PointerEvent | WheelEvent): DOMPointReadOnly`
=== `private onPointerDown(event: PointerEvent): void`
=== `private onPointerUp(): void`
=== `private onPointerMove(event: PointerEvent): void`
=== `private onScroll(event: WheelEvent): void`
=== `private addDrawing(drawing: SVGElement): void
=== `private getDrawingEdge(vertexA: DrawingVertex, vertexB: DrawingVertex): DrawingEdge`
=== `private drawEdge(vertexA: DrawingVertex, vertexB: DrawingVertex): void`
=== `private animate(): void`
=== `public static getInstance(): Canvas`
=== `public draw(graph: Graph<DrawingVertices>): void`
=== `public get height(): number`
=== `public get width(): number`
=== `public get center(): Point`

== Behaviours

The Canvas only supports two behaviours: Panning and zooming. Both are implemented by the `CanvasEvents` module.
